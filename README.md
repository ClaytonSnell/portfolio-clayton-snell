## Description
This was an assignment to see how well we picked up the basics of css and HTML. In the process of learning to code I have mainly focuesed on javascript, and more complex languages. However, I think for me this was one of the hardest assignments. I had alot of code copied from various websites and tinkered with this about once every few weeks, but never even had one commit. I have since scrapped the whole thing and started fresh. Used on of the class assignments for a basic template and I believe I will have all requirements done and turned in, in one day.

## HTML

I used alot of the HTMl in assignment 12 to start the assignment. It comprised of the basics needed such as a nav bar, body, ect.. I fiddled around with adding in the div that contains my pic.


## CSS

I again used starter code from assignment 12 to help with starter code and a basic platform for the Portfolio. Also used assingments 25 to pull information on how to style. I arranged the root to have colors that could be used, such as var(--light), 

## Uses
I hated this project. I skipped over it because I had absolutely zero experience with coding when I signed up for the class. That being said it is surprising how far I have come. This could be used as a cover letter or opening page to a more complex Portfolio in my opinion.
