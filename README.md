## Description
This was an assignment to see how well we picked up the basics of css and HTML. In the process of learning to code I have mainly focuesed on javascript, and more complex languages. However, I think for me this was one of the hardest assignments. I had alot of code copied from various websites and tinkered with this about once every few weeks, but never even had one commit. I have since scrapped the whole thing and started fresh. Used one of the class assignments for a basic template and I believe I will have all requirements done and turned in at last.

## HTML

I used alot of the HTMl in assignment 12 to start the assignment. It comprised of the basics needed such as a nav bar, body, ect.. I fiddled around with adding in the div that contains my pic.


## CSS

I again used starter code from assignment 12 to help form basic platform for the Portfolio. Also used assingments 25 to pull information on how to style. I arranged the root to have colors that could be used globally, such as var(--light). I made it so the links in the nav bar go to the correspoding headers in the page

## Uses
I hated this project. I skipped over it because I had zero experience with coding when I signed up for the class. That being said it is surprising how far I have come. This could be used as a cover letter or opening page to a more complex Portfolio. It can also be gone back to and worked on as I futher my experience in the field.

## Link

Last few things, just want to work with a tutor or classmate to link the stuff in contact me, maybe mess around with the cards so the first is bigger as well. This is ready to turn in though for passing credit
